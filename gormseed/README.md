# Gormseed

Gormseed is a command-line utility designed to work seamlessly with Gormseeder, providing an efficient and structured approach to creating and managing database seeders for projects using the Gorm ORM in Golang. While Gorm handles the intricacies of database interactions and migrations, Gormseed focuses on the vital task of populating your database with initial or sample data.

With Gormseed, you can easily generate seeder files that are organized and maintainable. Gormseed is particularly useful for developers who need a reliable and straightforward way to manage data population in their applications, complementing Gorm's powerful ORM capabilities with an equally robust data seeding solution.

## How to install
```bash
go install github.com/raspiantoro/gormseeder/gormseed/cli@latest
